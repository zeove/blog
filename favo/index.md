**Hip Hip Hurrah! Artists' Party at Skagen - 1888**

Around 1870, growing numbers of Scandinavian (Danish, Finnish, Norwegian and Swedish) artists took to visiting Paris to attended the school of Léon Bonnat, the Académie Julian, or the Académie Colarossi. Some of them were also tutored by Jean-Léon Gérôme.

In due course the artists took the idea of the artists' colony back to Scandinavia with them. The most famous of the northern colonies was at Skagen in Denmark.

Hip, Hip, Hurrah! is typical of the work produced by the Skagen Painters; very much in the style of the French Impressionists and Naturalists, it celebrates the play of light in the scene but at the same time it harks back to the tradition of artists of the Danish Golden Age. The composition of this painting was based on a photograph taken in summer 1884. The party was in the garden of the Anchers (husband and wife were both artist) at Skagen. We see the artists raising their champagne glasses in a toast. The motif of movement captured in the male group is nicely complemented by the tranquillity of the seated women and the child.

**Ice Skating - 1615**

Hendrick Avercamp was a Dutch painter. As one of the first landscape painters of the 17th-century Dutch school, he specialized in painting the Netherlands in winter—his work gaining international reknown. Avercamp's paintings are colorful and lively, with carefully crafted images of the people in the landscape. Many of his paintings feature people ice skating on frozen lakes.

Avercamp's work enjoyed great popularity and he sold his drawings, many of which were tinted with water-color as finished pictures to be pasted into the albums of collectors.

Avercamp probably painted in his studio on the basis of sketches he had made in the winter. . The passion for painting skating characters probably came from his childhood, during which he enjoyed skating with his parents. The last quarter of the 16th century, during which Avercamp was born, was one of the coldest periods of the Little Ice Age.

**Self-Portrait - 1783**

Marie-Gabrielle Capet was a French Neoclassical painter. She excelled as a portrait painter, and her works include oil paintings, watercolours and miniatures.

She counted among other customers several members of the royal family, and other members of Paris society. At that time the Royal Academy of painting and sculpture had limited the number of female painters to only four. It was a unique situation, that Capet was able to make a living as painter.

Capet's name appeared as one of the 21 women who displayed works in the Salon of 1791, immediately after the French Revolution. In this self-portrait, Capet is shown holding drawing chalk clasped in a holder as she faces the easel. The painting is a splendid rendition of her youthful face, showing her in the fresh beauty of her 22nd year. The blue satin dress, boldly open at the chest, was fashionable in her day and blue ribbons of the same material reveal the delicate lightness of Rococo.

**Magpie - 1869**

The Magpie is considered one of Monet's best snowscape paintings of approximately 140 snowscapes painted by the artist. It was created during the winter of 1868–1869 near the commune of Étretat in Normandy. Monet's patron, Louis Joachim Gaudibert, helped arrange a house in Étretat for Monet's girlfriend Camille Doncieux and their newborn son, allowing Monet to paint in relative comfort, surrounded by his family.

Between 1867 and 1893, Monet and fellow Impressionists Alfred Sisley and Camille Pissarro painted hundreds of landscapes illustrating the natural effect of snow (effet de neige). Similar winter paintings of lesser quantity were produced by Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Gustave Caillebotte, and Paul Gauguin. Art historians believe that a series of severe winters in France contributed to an increase in the number of winter landscapes produced by Impressionists.

The painting features one of the first examples of Monet's use of colored shadows, which would later become associated with the Impressionist movement. This innovative use of light and color led to its rejection by the Paris Salon of 1869.

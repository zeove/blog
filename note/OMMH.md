**Hip Hip Hurrah! Artists' Party at Skagen - 1888**

Around 1870, growing numbers of Scandinavian (Danish, Finnish, Norwegian and Swedish) artists took to visiting Paris to attended the school of Léon Bonnat, the Académie Julian, or the Académie Colarossi. Some of them were also tutored by Jean-Léon Gérôme.

In due course the artists took the idea of the artists' colony back to Scandinavia with them. The most famous of the northern colonies was at Skagen in Denmark.

Hip, Hip, Hurrah! is typical of the work produced by the Skagen Painters; very much in the style of the French Impressionists and Naturalists, it celebrates the play of light in the scene but at the same time it harks back to the tradition of artists of the Danish Golden Age. The composition of this painting was based on a photograph taken in summer 1884. The party was in the garden of the Anchers (husband and wife were both artist) at Skagen. We see the artists raising their champagne glasses in a toast. The motif of movement captured in the male group is nicely complemented by the tranquillity of the seated women and the child.

**Ice Skating - 1615**

Hendrick Avercamp was a Dutch painter. As one of the first landscape painters of the 17th-century Dutch school, he specialized in painting the Netherlands in winter—his work gaining international reknown. Avercamp's paintings are colorful and lively, with carefully crafted images of the people in the landscape. Many of his paintings feature people ice skating on frozen lakes.

Avercamp's work enjoyed great popularity and he sold his drawings, many of which were tinted with water-color as finished pictures to be pasted into the albums of collectors.

Avercamp probably painted in his studio on the basis of sketches he had made in the winter. . The passion for painting skating characters probably came from his childhood, during which he enjoyed skating with his parents. The last quarter of the 16th century, during which Avercamp was born, was one of the coldest periods of the Little Ice Age.

**Self-Portrait - 1783**

Marie-Gabrielle Capet was a French Neoclassical painter. She excelled as a portrait painter, and her works include oil paintings, watercolours and miniatures.

She counted among other customers several members of the royal family, and other members of Paris society. At that time the Royal Academy of painting and sculpture had limited the number of female painters to only four. It was a unique situation, that Capet was able to make a living as painter.

Capet's name appeared as one of the 21 women who displayed works in the Salon of 1791, immediately after the French Revolution. In this self-portrait, Capet is shown holding drawing chalk clasped in a holder as she faces the easel. The painting is a splendid rendition of her youthful face, showing her in the fresh beauty of her 22nd year. The blue satin dress, boldly open at the chest, was fashionable in her day and blue ribbons of the same material reveal the delicate lightness of Rococo.

**Magpie - 1869**

The Magpie is considered one of Monet's best snowscape paintings of approximately 140 snowscapes painted by the artist. It was created during the winter of 1868–1869 near the commune of Étretat in Normandy. Monet's patron, Louis Joachim Gaudibert, helped arrange a house in Étretat for Monet's girlfriend Camille Doncieux and their newborn son, allowing Monet to paint in relative comfort, surrounded by his family.

Between 1867 and 1893, Monet and fellow Impressionists Alfred Sisley and Camille Pissarro painted hundreds of landscapes illustrating the natural effect of snow (effet de neige). Similar winter paintings of lesser quantity were produced by Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Gustave Caillebotte, and Paul Gauguin. Art historians believe that a series of severe winters in France contributed to an increase in the number of winter landscapes produced by Impressionists.

The painting features one of the first examples of Monet's use of colored shadows, which would later become associated with the Impressionist movement. This innovative use of light and color led to its rejection by the Paris Salon of 1869.

**The Garden Umbrella - 1910**

"The Garden Parasol" looks like a French Impressionism painting when you first lay your eyes on it. However, Frederick Carl Frieseke was an American artist that lived in France during the French Impressionist movement. His work mainly focused on dappled sunlight, female subjects, and gardens, all of which are subjects shown in "The Garden Parasol"

"I never compose a picture before Nature, but I paint what I see that is interesting, and which appeals to me at that moment. I put down whatever I see before me. I avoid being conventional as much as possible, for most picture making is conventional. I never change the drawing of a tree, or leave out a bed of flowers. I may not see them, if they do not add to the beauty of the whole." said Frieseke.

This painting was created by Frieseke to conjure the peacefulness he and his wife Sadie found spending their summers in the French countryside. The setting is the garden at the Friesekes’ house in Giverny, France, which was located very close to the home, and gardens of the esteemed impressionist painter Claude Monet.

**Landscape With Snow - 1888**

Landscape with Snow is believed to be one of the first paintings that van Gogh made in Arles. It is one of at least ten oil and watercolor paintings that the artist made of a snowy landscape from 1882 to 1889. In a letter to his brother Theo about February 24, 1888, Van Gogh describes having completed three paintings in as many days, one of them "a landscape in the snow.

Van Gogh was a gread admirer an an avid collector of Japanese art woodcut prints. He came to Arles hoping to establish an artistic community in an environment commensurate with his Oriental ideal. The scene may have been inspired by the prints with snowy scenes, but it also follows conventions of seventeenth-century Dutch landscape painting in its gradation of color of the sky.

**Family Reunion - 1867**

Before his early death in battle during the Franco-Prussian war in 1870, Frédéric Bazille was close to Renoir and Monet, particularly admiring their open-air paintings. During a summer holiday in the family home at Méric, near Montpellier, he worked on this motif in a fairly large painting showing ten of his close family gathered on the terrace, and adding himself at the far left of the painting.

Each figure is also a portrait and almost all are looking towards the spectator as if at a camera. As a result, although it is a group portrait of family life, the postures are rather stiff. The execution seems restrained and Bazille reworked the canvas extensively during the winter and returned to it again a year later after it was shown in the Salon, replacing little dogs with a contrived still life.

**Entrance of a Mansion Around The Hague - 1935**

Winter officially began a week ago, and cold weather has arrived in many parts of the world. If the thought of winter makes you want to hide for the next few months, take comfort in how beautiful the snow can be.

Dutch artist Louis Apol (1850-1936) must have understood both the beauty and the reality of cold, snowy winters, since he made his career painting winter landscapes. In fact, Apol loved the ice and snow so much that he joined an expedition to the North Pole in 1880.

While the Dutch have a centuries-long tradition of representing the winter in paintings, Apol was one of only a few Dutch artists to focus primarily on the landscape and weather. He often minimized or completely excluded people, animals, and seasonal activity from his works.

Apol’s paintings are generally muted in tone – primarily using shades of white, gray, brown, and tan with just enough brighter color to create a sense of light and life. Although his paintings depict cold weather and un-populated scenes, they never feel bleak or lifeless. Instead, they remind us how elegant, peaceful, and even magical winter weather can be. Try to keep them in mind next time it snows.

**Portrait of Rodin - 1884**

This portrait of the famous French sculptor Auguste Rodin was painted by John Singer Sargent in 1884. It is inscribed across the top "à mon ami Rodin John S. Sargent 1884" ("to my friend Rodin John S. Sargent 1884"). John Singer Sargent was an American painter, mostly known among his contemporaries as an accomplished portrait painter. Sargent and Rodin probably met in Paris in the early 1880s and an artistic exchange ensued, with Rodin starting to work on a bust of Sargent and Sargent starting to work on a portrait of Rodin. While there is no record of Sargent's bust by Rodin (it was probably never completed, but a statuette of Sargent was delivered by Rodin to Sargent instead), Sargent finished this powerful portrait of Rodin and delivered it to him. Sargent's portrait of Rodin ensures the viewer’s focus is on Rodin's head and gaze. Rodin's bust and the background are painted in dark tones, so that we are not distracted from Rodin's piercing gaze and long, ginger beard. With this portrait, Sargent manages to convey both Rodin’s physical appearance and his strong personality. Years later, in a newspaper interview Rodin declared that Sargent was "le Van Dyck de l'époque" ("the Van Dyck of our times").

**The Big Bayberry Bush (The Bayberry Bush) - 1895**

William Merritt Chase was born on November 1st, 1849 in Nineveh, Indiana. Throughout his lifetime, he expanded his oeuvre to include portraiture, landscapes, and still life, eventually coming to be regarded as one of American Impressionism’s most prominent painters and teachers.

The loose, organic brushwork that initially garnered him the attention of his instructors came fully into form in his later landscape paintings. In 1891, Chase (reluctantly) accepted a position teaching at the Shinnecock School in Southampton, Long Island. For the next two decades he was a well-loved and respected teacher in the school’s Art Village, the first to teach painting en plein air. “The Bayberry Bush,” painted in 1895, displays the carefree brushwork Chase used to such success. It features three young women walking amongst the scrub in the foreground of a rural, gambrel-roofed house. Known for prominently presenting figures in his landscapes, Chase made them the only sources of pure white in the image besides the clouds, going so far as to garnish the outfit of the subject on the far right with a red bow.

The earth tones that comprise the low vegetation are reflected in the grey shingles and red brick of the house in the background, blurring the lines between landscape and residence. In the distance the earth slopes gradually, meeting a faintly clouded horizon that lightens as it disappears. Chase creates a gentle whimsy in a landscape that had been considered barren and even depressing by some of his contemporaries. As a result, American Impressionist landscape painting spread to such locations as Cape Cod, Massachusetts and Mendota, Minnesota, as well as Carmel, California.- Anthony deFeo

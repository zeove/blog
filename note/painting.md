**Horse and Train - 1954**

Momentum and tension draw the viewer into the scene of a galloping horse on a collision course with a locomotive speeding down the tracks. The probable impending doom of the horse is very disconcerting, yet the viewer cannot look away. Canadian artist Alex Colville was a master of creating scenes that at times intrigue and at other times discomfort the viewer. There is always a sense that there is more to his paintings that what is revealed.
Horse and Train was inspired by a verse written by South African poet Roy Campbell: “Against a regiment I oppose a brain / And a dark horse against an armoured train". Like Colville’s other works, it was meticulously planned and painstakingly executed. Layer upon layer of paint was slowly applied to produce a smooth and stark image.
Weighing life and death, good and evil was borne from Colville's experience as a war artist in World War II. He was in his early twenties when he was deployed throughout Europe to document what he saw including open mass graves of the liberated Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in 1945. The haunting images he witnessed remained with him and profoundly affected his art. He was likewise influenced by American Realist painters Edward Hopper and George Tooker. Colville's works did not incite people to action and reform but provided silent commentary on the world around him. His motifs included family, animals, and landscapes near his home in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. The train tracks depicted in Horse and Train run through the marshes at Aulac, New Brunswick.
The gleaming rails, reflecting the beam of the train's headlight, guide the viewer's eyes along the tracks toward the oncoming train. By positioning the viewer alongside the tracks, facing the train head-on like the undeterred horse, Colville heightens the sense of danger and urgency. Despite the cognizance of motion, it is a static scene—a moment frozen in time. The viewer is left to wonder, “How will it end?”

**Bridge of Glory - 1923**

Nicholas Roerich was a Russian painter, writer, archaeologist, theosophist, perceived by some in Russia as an enlightener, philosopher, and public figure, who in his youth was influenced by a movement in Russian society around the occult. He was interested in hypnosis and other spiritual practices and his paintings are said to have hypnotic expression.

Born in Saint Petersburg, Russia, to a well-to-do notary public of Baltic German ancestry and a Russian mother, he lived in various places around the world until his death in Naggar, Himachal Pradesh, India. Trained as an artist and a lawyer, his main interests were literature, philosophy, archaeology, and especially art. Roerich was a dedicated activist for the cause of preserving art and architecture during times of war. He earned several nominations for the Nobel Peace Prize long list.

Today, Roerich is best known for his contributions to art and culture. In his Banner of Peace address of 1931 he said: “Culture is the accumulation of highest Bliss, highest Beauty, highest Knowledge.”

Four years later his brainchild, the Roerich Pact, was signed into action at the White House in 1935. The document declares that “treasures of culture” should be”respected and protected in time of war.”

**The Sheepfold, Moonlight - 1856-1860**

In this nocturnal scene, the waning moon throws a mysterious light across the plain extending between the villages of Barbizon and Chailly.

Millet was recorded as saying of the solitary shepherd: Oh, how I wish I could make those who see my work feel the splendors and terrors of the night! One ought to be able to make people hear the songs, the silences, and murmurings of the air. They should feel the infinite.

Although educated and trained in Paris, Millet was born into a peasant family from the Normandy region of northern France. He drew on this background, specializing in scenes of peasant life. An outbreak of cholera in 1849 forced Millet to leave Paris with his family and settle in the village of Barbizon, where he became acquainted with the Barbizon artists Théodore Rousseau, Virgile Narcisse Diaz de la Peña, Constant Troyon, and Antoine-Louis Barye.

![Sunflowers](https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/401/31419160454_68223d7d51.jpg) 

**Sunflowers - 1887**

Vincent van Gogh painted many floral still lifes over the course of his short life as an artist. About a dozen of these depict sunflowers. Four of these works – including our painting – don’t show the flowers in full bloom in a vase, but, rather, lying wilted on a table or on the floor. Just like poor people scarred by life or old, worn out shoes, the artist considered wilted flowers worthy of being painted.

Even though the flowers are wilted, the artist presents them in an extremely lively, vibrant and dynamic way. From the respective center of the two blossoms, different-colored brushstrokes spread across the canvas in a swirling motion. By applying the paint in rhythmic brushstrokes, the artist has completely dissolved the base on which the two flowers are lying. This makes the painting appear flat and no longer three-dimensional.

As with almost all of van Gogh’s work, the colors and the application of color express the inner tension of the artist while painting.

Out of financial necessity, van Gogh painted over some of his works. An x-ray of our painting revealed the outlines of the portrait of a man underneath the sunflowers, probably a self-portrait.

Van Gogh had given the painting to his artist friend Paul Gauguin. From Gauguin, both paintings came into the possession of the art dealer Ambroise Vollard, who sold them to the painter Edgar Degas. When the private collection of Degas was liquidated, the painting came into the possession of the Hahnloser family in the early 1970s, who eventually donated it to the art museum in Bern.

![The Pine Tree At St. Tropez](https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/522/31450339433_53004ba57b.jpg) 

**The Pine Tree At St. Tropez - 1909**

The centre of the painting depicts a tree with a colourful crown which takes up the majority of the canvas. Placed against a background of a pale blue sky, the crown seems to make everything in its immediate surroundings subservient to its movements. Instead of using precise brushstrokes of singular form, Signac complicates the pictorial space and gives its formal flexibility which manifests in the apparent movement of the the branches. The work is divisionist in style and has a tangibly mosaic-like quality, with the fluctuating and yet still harmonious colour interplay splitting up the image into clusters of varying visual temperature. The artificial colour palette used by Signac conveys the impression of the emotional experience of the tree rather than the visual experience, and through subverting traditional colour use the viewer is momentarily transported into Signac's emotional mindset (in relation to the tree) and simultaneously coaxed into sharing it for a few brief moments.

**A Flat Calm on a High-Prowed Boat - 1925**

In 1920, in office with the portfolio of Minister of Munitions, he sent five paintings to be exhibited in Paris, under the hidden name of Charles Morin, where they would be sold for £30. Recognition would come under a new pseudonym, Mr.Winter, when the Royal Academy, in 1947, conferred the title of Honorary Academician Extraordinary, after two pieces were accepted.

But not always have canvas and painters played a happy part in politics. First of all, for those who regard politics and history as boring, go have a look at Józef Piłsudski’s crazy biography - this Polish hero had a life as imaginative as Jack London’s tales. In one episode, after refusing running for Presidency, his friend and elected president Narutowicz was assassinated. The killer was Eligiusz Niewiadomski, a Modernist Painter, who initially intended to murder Piłsudski. The Painter shot the newly elected president during the opening of an art exhibition, at the Zachęta Art Gallery.

Churchill once said: “Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm”, a great advice in favour of humanity, if only a young frustrated painter kept on painting after being refused, two times, admission in the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna…

**Cherry Time - 1912**

Helen Galloway McNicoll was a Canadian impressionist painter. Born in Ontario and raised in Montreal, Helen Galloway McNicoll was raised in a wealthy upper-middle-class family. She contracted scarlet fever at the age of two which left her deaf for the remainder of her life. Her family, intent on Helen remaining an included member of society, brought in private tutors to teach her lip reading as well as her educational schooling and piano lessons. Helen's early life, though somewhat restrictive, was not isolated. As well as the tutors, she became a member of a local deaf community. With her private education and lip reading skill she was able to attend art schools in her adulthood with all the other young artists of her day.

She began her art education in Montreal, attending art classes at the AAM, the Art Association of Montreal where she studies for two years. From Montreal, Helen travelled to England to attend a few of the prominent and experimental art schools practicing there at the time. After England, Helen lived briefly in France to gain real formal instructions in the visual arts. Inspired by her time there, she opened up a small studio where she painted continuously. In 1906, Helen returned to England to continue her art studies at Julius Olsson's School of Landscape and Sea Painting in St. Ives, Cornwall. This school was also the liberating spirit that helped another Canadian Impressionist, Emily Carr, find happiness and fulfillment in her art, as Helen McNicoll found in hers. She died at the age of 35.

**Metchosin - 1935**

Emily Carr was a Canadian artist and writer heavily inspired by the Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast. One of the first painters in Canada to adopt a Modernist and Post-Impressionist painting style, Carr did not receive widespread recognition for her work until late in her life. As she matured, the subject matter of her painting shifted from aboriginal themes to landscapes—forest scenes in particular. As a writer, Carr was one of the earliest chroniclers of life in British Columbia. 

Although influenced by the Group of Seven, especially Lawren Harris, the British Columbia-based Emily Carr developed a unique style of landscape painting that sets her apart from her contemporaries. Drawn initially to West Coast First Nations’ villages and totem poles for her subjects, in the 1930s Carr increasingly depicted the uninhabited landscape. Metchosin, the name of a district on Vancouver Island, includes two phenomena central to her practice: forest and sky. For Carr, nature was imbued with the divine, an idea communicated by representing trees as if they are reaching toward and swirling into the sky. Literally entwined with itself, Carr’s natural world is represented through a series of undulating movements, not a collection of static objects.

**Moose on the Head of Ram River - 1940s**

Carl Clemens Moritz Rungius was a leading American wildlife artist. He was born in Germany though he immigrated to the United States and he spent his career painting in the western United States and Canada. Active primarily in the first half of the 20th century, he earned a reputation as the most important big game painter and the first career wildlife artist in North America.

In 1894, Rungius's Uncle Clemens Fulda invited him to hunt moose in Maine. Shortly after, in 1895, he traveled to Wyoming, which for him was an exotic experience. Open skies, mountain scenes and big game abounded. He made extensive studies of his trophies, and stalked game, which allowed him to gain a better understanding of the animals he painted. His summer in Wyoming persuaded Rugius that the United States would be his new home; “I painted from the collected material and later in the spring of 1896, I went back to Germany...My decision to cut all ties with the Old World and to live in America got good was due in no small part to this first Wyoming trip. For my heart was in the West.”

Rungius was an avid sportsman, and spent more time in the wilderness than other artists. By direct observation in nature, he was able to gain an exceptional insight into the animals and their environment. The artist painted both landscapes and wildlife, often with both in a single picture. He situated animals in their natural environment, a practice that was new to painting in early twentieth century North America. His paintings are highly romanticized, and represent an Eden-like world without any signs of a human impact.

![Strolling along the Seashore](https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/654/31450374203_de1105bffe.jpg) 

**Strolling along the Seashore - 1909**

Painted during the summer of 1909 at the beach in Valencia, after Sorolla’s triumphant success in the United States, Strolling along the seashore is undoubtedly one of the artist’s most important works.

The water and the sandy seashore, depicted here in long blue, purple and turquoise brushstrokes, become an abstract backdrop for the refined figures of the artist’s wife and daughter Maria.

The suggestion of the breeze in their floating draperies intensifies the fleeting moment
captured here by the artist, along with the use of a clearly photographic frame which cuts through Clotilde’s wide-brimmed straw hat and leaves an empty swathe of sand in the lower foreground.

Although this is the same setting as in other Valencia seashore scenes, the tone here is very different. What we see here is a perfect example of the iconographic genre of the ‘elegant promenade’ with well-dressed bourgeois figures strolling along the seashore.

![Steamboat Leaving Boulogne](https://c3.staticflickr.com/1/428/32057590842_ef500b6001.jpg) 

**Steamboat Leaving Boulogne - 1864**

Edouard Manet became one of the most famous painters in Paris after exhibiting several works that shocked the public with their bold treatment of form, color, space, and sexually oriented themes. Probably seeking relief from the harsh criticism he had received, he left Paris and went on a vacation with his family in the northern port of Boulogne-sur-Mer. This is where he painted this painting, one of his earliest presenting the sea.

This work represent a breakthrough for the artist. Although his bold, flat brushwork outraged his critics—what wasn't surprising for Manet—it inspired his Impressionist colleagues in the next decade.

Look at the raised horizon, flattened objects and space, and asymmetrical composition—they were inspired by Japanese woodblock prints, which had become extremely popular in France at the time. Manet rendered the water in lively horizontal strokes of blue and green paint, which anticipated the sketch-like Impressionist style.

![Sewing the Sail](https://c3.staticflickr.com/1/301/31830594130_59994a8a8a.jpg) 

**Sewing the Sail - 1896**

The painting is one of the most important masterpieces shown on the exhibition "Sorolla in Paris" at Museo Sorolla in Madrid. An exhibition that traces the history of the international recognition of Sorolla, from his first trip to Paris, with only twenty-three years, until his victory in the large group exhibitions and his definitive consecration in his individual exhibition at the Gallery Georges Petit in Paris in 1906.

Sorolla completed "Sewing the sail" during a summer stay in Cabanil. This composition, which seems to be inspired by a popular stamp, shows women in a landscaped courtyard that sew a white sail, which inflates the dimensions of light. Awarded in Munich and Vienna, the artist sent this work to the Exhibition of Fine Arts in Madrid in 1889.

![A Song of Spring](https://c5.staticflickr.com/1/610/31830597060_e78170f3eb.jpg) 

**A Song of Spring - 1913**

Maximilian Lenz was an Austrian painter, graphic artist and sculptor. During his career's most important period, he was a Symbolist, but later his work became increasingly naturalistic.

In the early 1890s Lenz worked as a designer of banknotes in Buenos Aires. In 1897, after returning home, he became one of the founding members of the Secession in Vienna, and participated several times in its exhibitions. His One World draws on the time's prevailing currents, including dreamlike and fantastic imagery painted in intense colour. It was shown at the Fourth Exhibition of the Vienna Secession in spring 1899, and received critical praise for its "graceful charm and dreamy yet sparkling beauty" and its mood of "pure grace and musical euphony". The famous Secession's periodical Ver Sacrum featured the work in the same year.

This painting was influenced by the dancer Isadora Duncan's 1904 stay in Vienna, sharing her symbolic themes of cyclic renewal and rebirth and featuring mediaeval costume. These ideas and a connection with dance are also prominent within Klimt's work, and the Symbolist movement as a whole.

![The Blue Rigi, Sunrise](https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/487/31830588920_a8c4f85b91.jpg) 

**The Blue Rigi, Sunrise - 1842**

"The Blue Rigi", a misty, high-backed mountain which looms over Lake Lucerne in was created during a series of Turner's visits to Italy and Switzerland in the 1830s and 40s. It is one of his most famous watercolors.

The changing effects of light and colour, sun and mist so fascinated Turner that he painted the view obsessively. As well as the Blue Rigi, there is a Red Rigi, a Dark Rigi, and upwards of 30 sketches and drawings of the mountain, plus many other prospects of the Alps around Lucerne. They made a powerful impact back in Britain and, due in part to Turner’s work, The Rigi quickly acquired an iconic status among the leisured classes.

![The Misses Vickers](https://c3.staticflickr.com/1/705/31830591450_3fdfbc714d.jpg) 

**The Misses Vickers - 1884**

The Times of May 22nd 1886 reviewed the painting thus: "Three young ladies, painted in a thin and almost ghostly fashion, gaze straight out of the picture at you. They seem as insubstantial as beings from another world; these faces, medicated rather than painted, these cloudy dresses, these unsubstantial chairs and tables, are they portraits or are they mere suggestions for portraits? Seeing the picture for the first time... one inevitably answers that they are mere sketches; that the artist no doubt intends to carry his work much further. But a second and a third examination bring one to a different mind, and almost, if not quite, convince one that this art, at once very bold and very subtle, is legitimate; that the painter has really got in this apparent slighting the truth about his sitters, and that no further touches could put more life or more character into face or form or accessories."

![Mother](https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/336/31365007024_f7c567d339.jpg) 

**Mother - 1895**

This canvas commemorates the birth of Elena, the artist’s younger daughter, on 12 July 1895, although the painting was not completed until 1900.

Mother and daughter are shown resting peacefully or perhaps exhausted, turned towards each other, with only their heads emerging from a sea of white—the baby still rosy from the birth and the mother with a subtle pallor. This canvas is an exceptional technical feat and also one of the best examples of Sorolla’s ability to transmit intense physical sensations and equally intense emotion through his handling of light and colour. The emotion of the husband/father and the artist’s gaze are blended in the filtered light which caresses the whiteness from which the two heads emerge, as if the whole world is reduced to the all-absorbing intimacy of this moment of repose.

![The Cardsharps](https://c5.staticflickr.com/1/583/31365013204_22daf65501.jpg) 

**The Cardsharps - 1595**

In "The Cardsharps", the players are engaged in a game of primero, a forerunner of poker. Engrossed in his cards at left is the dupe, unaware that the older cardsharp signals his accomplice with a raised, gloved hand (the fingertips exposed, better to feel marked cards). At right, the young cheat looks expectantly toward the boy and reaches behind his back to pull a hidden card from his breeches. No party can see or know everything they might wish to. There are things that the viewer can't observe though the figures can, and things the figures can't observe and the viewer can. The scene is constructed as a circuit of seeing and not-seeing, knowledge and ignorance, trust and deceit. The boy trusts in the invisibility of his cards. The cheats trust in the invisibility of their scheme. They must trust in their own alliance too. And something the viewer can see suggests this trust may be misplaced. Caravaggio has treated this subject not as a caricature of vice but in a novelistic way, in which the interaction of gesture and glance evokes the drama of deception and lost innocence in the most human of terms.

![Waterlilies](https://c5.staticflickr.com/1/579/31830586380_b5c522b852.jpg) 

**Waterlilies - 1904**

On this day in 1840, one of the founders of French Impressionism, the great Claude Monet was born. Monet was the most consistent and prolific practitioner of the movement's philosophy. He continued to develop Impressionist assumptions throughout his long life.

Water Lilies were the main focus of Monet's artistic production during the last thirty years of his life. He created approximately 250 oil paintings with these flowers. What's interesting, many of the works were painted while Monet suffered from cataracts — but today's painting is not one of them.

Every year, from spring to fall, the artist set up easels around the pond next to his home in Giverny so he could capture sensations on several canvases at once and rework them later in his workshop. The Waterlilies at MuMa, painted in 1904, are part of a suite of forty-eight canvases known as, "Waterlilies, a Series of Waterscapes"—shown at Durand-Ruel’s gallery in Paris in 1909.

In this painting Monet shows that he is a god of color. The Giverny garden became his laboratory that led to a genuine transformation of his paintings, where color prevailed over form. His undertaking signalled the abstraction that would be developed by the artists of the New York School in the wake of World War II.

**Wind-Swept Sands - 1894**

William Merritt Chase was an American painter, known is an exponent of Impressionism and as a teacher. He is also responsible for establishing the Chase School, which later would become Parsons The New School for Design. Like most of his American contemporaries, Chase was eclectic, borrowing with pride and pleasure from many international styles, past and present. Chase's teaching method was rooted in the French Impressionist and in the Barbizon School tradition of painting outdoors in order to take advantage of natural light and changing weather conditions. Between 1891 and 1901, Chase was a highly influential teacher at the Shinnecock Summer Art School in Long Island, New York. This is where he painted "Wind-Swept Sands". As you can see, the rapid brushstrokes and the overall gray tonality indicate an overcast day, while a hint of blue at the horizon suggests the elusive presence of the sun.

**Portrait with Geraniums - 1904**

a portrait by Stanislaw Wyspianski, a true man of Renaissance (but living in the 19th century of course). Wyspianski was a playwright, poet, theatre director, originator of modern Polish theatre and of course — an artist.For a short time he approached Impressionism in his easel paintings, but the characteristic feature of his monumental polychromes and stained glass windows was the decorativeness of synthetics and nabis, strengthened with a dramatic expression. In his sharply outlined portraits he got out the psychology of personages with a strong, frequently curved, line— whereas children were treated with lyricism. In landscapes he combined the observation of nature with the eternal mystery of nature’s life, complicating their symbolic meaning with historiosophic messages. After a long fight with disease, he died prematurely at the age of 38.

Wyspianski most frequently used soft pastel techniques; his first pastel drawings were produced between 1890 and 1894. They mainly present the artist's family, friends and other artists. Here the artist portraited a 16 year old Liza Parenska, a daughter of a famous Cracow doctor, with a clenched fist and face expressing confidence. Liza with such a determination in her eyes seems to be quite a grown up young lady. Unfortunately,fate was not kind to her — she died of a drug overdose when she was 33, widowed a couple of months earlier, depressed and disillusioned.

![Hip Hip Hurrah! Artists' Party at Skagen](https://c7.staticflickr.com/1/353/31746229950_917cc15b26.jpg) 

**Hip Hip Hurrah! Artists' Party at Skagen - 1888**

Around 1870, growing numbers of Scandinavian (Danish, Finnish, Norwegian and Swedish) artists took to visiting Paris to attended the school of Léon Bonnat, the Académie Julian, or the Académie Colarossi. Some of them were also tutored by Jean-Léon Gérôme.

In due course the artists took the idea of the artists' colony back to Scandinavia with them. The most famous of the northern colonies was at Skagen in Denmark.

Hip, Hip, Hurrah! is typical of the work produced by the Skagen Painters; very much in the style of the French Impressionists and Naturalists, it celebrates the play of light in the scene but at the same time it harks back to the tradition of artists of the Danish Golden Age. The composition of this painting was based on a photograph taken in summer 1884. The party was in the garden of the Anchers (husband and wife were both artist) at Skagen. We see the artists raising their champagne glasses in a toast. The motif of movement captured in the male group is nicely complemented by the tranquillity of the seated women and the child.

**Ice Skating - 1615**

Hendrick Avercamp was a Dutch painter. As one of the first landscape painters of the 17th-century Dutch school, he specialized in painting the Netherlands in winter—his work gaining international reknown. Avercamp's paintings are colorful and lively, with carefully crafted images of the people in the landscape. Many of his paintings feature people ice skating on frozen lakes.

Avercamp's work enjoyed great popularity and he sold his drawings, many of which were tinted with water-color as finished pictures to be pasted into the albums of collectors.

Avercamp probably painted in his studio on the basis of sketches he had made in the winter. . The passion for painting skating characters probably came from his childhood, during which he enjoyed skating with his parents. The last quarter of the 16th century, during which Avercamp was born, was one of the coldest periods of the Little Ice Age.

**Self-Portrait - 1783**

Marie-Gabrielle Capet was a French Neoclassical painter. She excelled as a portrait painter, and her works include oil paintings, watercolours and miniatures.

She counted among other customers several members of the royal family, and other members of Paris society. At that time the Royal Academy of painting and sculpture had limited the number of female painters to only four. It was a unique situation, that Capet was able to make a living as painter.

Capet's name appeared as one of the 21 women who displayed works in the Salon of 1791, immediately after the French Revolution. In this self-portrait, Capet is shown holding drawing chalk clasped in a holder as she faces the easel. The painting is a splendid rendition of her youthful face, showing her in the fresh beauty of her 22nd year. The blue satin dress, boldly open at the chest, was fashionable in her day and blue ribbons of the same material reveal the delicate lightness of Rococo.

![Magpie](https://c5.staticflickr.com/6/5482/32082456916_0578418a05.jpg)

**Magpie - 1869**

The Magpie is considered one of Monet's best snowscape paintings of approximately 140 snowscapes painted by the artist. It was created during the winter of 1868–1869 near the commune of Étretat in Normandy. Monet's patron, Louis Joachim Gaudibert, helped arrange a house in Étretat for Monet's girlfriend Camille Doncieux and their newborn son, allowing Monet to paint in relative comfort, surrounded by his family.

Between 1867 and 1893, Monet and fellow Impressionists Alfred Sisley and Camille Pissarro painted hundreds of landscapes illustrating the natural effect of snow (effet de neige). Similar winter paintings of lesser quantity were produced by Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Gustave Caillebotte, and Paul Gauguin. Art historians believe that a series of severe winters in France contributed to an increase in the number of winter landscapes produced by Impressionists.

The painting features one of the first examples of Monet's use of colored shadows, which would later become associated with the Impressionist movement. This innovative use of light and color led to its rejection by the Paris Salon of 1869.

**The Garden Umbrella - 1910**

"The Garden Parasol" looks like a French Impressionism painting when you first lay your eyes on it. However, Frederick Carl Frieseke was an American artist that lived in France during the French Impressionist movement. His work mainly focused on dappled sunlight, female subjects, and gardens, all of which are subjects shown in "The Garden Parasol"

"I never compose a picture before Nature, but I paint what I see that is interesting, and which appeals to me at that moment. I put down whatever I see before me. I avoid being conventional as much as possible, for most picture making is conventional. I never change the drawing of a tree, or leave out a bed of flowers. I may not see them, if they do not add to the beauty of the whole." said Frieseke.

This painting was created by Frieseke to conjure the peacefulness he and his wife Sadie found spending their summers in the French countryside. The setting is the garden at the Friesekes’ house in Giverny, France, which was located very close to the home, and gardens of the esteemed impressionist painter Claude Monet.

![Landscape With Snow](https://c7.staticflickr.com/1/714/31746222510_f8f3953c6d.jpg)

**Landscape With Snow - 1888**

Landscape with Snow is believed to be one of the first paintings that van Gogh made in Arles. It is one of at least ten oil and watercolor paintings that the artist made of a snowy landscape from 1882 to 1889. In a letter to his brother Theo about February 24, 1888, Van Gogh describes having completed three paintings in as many days, one of them "a landscape in the snow.

Van Gogh was a gread admirer an an avid collector of Japanese art woodcut prints. He came to Arles hoping to establish an artistic community in an environment commensurate with his Oriental ideal. The scene may have been inspired by the prints with snowy scenes, but it also follows conventions of seventeenth-century Dutch landscape painting in its gradation of color of the sky.

**Family Reunion - 1867**

Before his early death in battle during the Franco-Prussian war in 1870, Frédéric Bazille was close to Renoir and Monet, particularly admiring their open-air paintings. During a summer holiday in the family home at Méric, near Montpellier, he worked on this motif in a fairly large painting showing ten of his close family gathered on the terrace, and adding himself at the far left of the painting.

Each figure is also a portrait and almost all are looking towards the spectator as if at a camera. As a result, although it is a group portrait of family life, the postures are rather stiff. The execution seems restrained and Bazille reworked the canvas extensively during the winter and returned to it again a year later after it was shown in the Salon, replacing little dogs with a contrived still life.

**Entrance of a Mansion Around The Hague - 1935**

Winter officially began a week ago, and cold weather has arrived in many parts of the world. If the thought of winter makes you want to hide for the next few months, take comfort in how beautiful the snow can be.

Dutch artist Louis Apol (1850-1936) must have understood both the beauty and the reality of cold, snowy winters, since he made his career painting winter landscapes. In fact, Apol loved the ice and snow so much that he joined an expedition to the North Pole in 1880.

While the Dutch have a centuries-long tradition of representing the winter in paintings, Apol was one of only a few Dutch artists to focus primarily on the landscape and weather. He often minimized or completely excluded people, animals, and seasonal activity from his works.

Apol’s paintings are generally muted in tone – primarily using shades of white, gray, brown, and tan with just enough brighter color to create a sense of light and life. Although his paintings depict cold weather and un-populated scenes, they never feel bleak or lifeless. Instead, they remind us how elegant, peaceful, and even magical winter weather can be. Try to keep them in mind next time it snows.

**Portrait of Rodin - 1884**

This portrait of the famous French sculptor Auguste Rodin was painted by John Singer Sargent in 1884. It is inscribed across the top "à mon ami Rodin John S. Sargent 1884" ("to my friend Rodin John S. Sargent 1884"). John Singer Sargent was an American painter, mostly known among his contemporaries as an accomplished portrait painter. Sargent and Rodin probably met in Paris in the early 1880s and an artistic exchange ensued, with Rodin starting to work on a bust of Sargent and Sargent starting to work on a portrait of Rodin. While there is no record of Sargent's bust by Rodin (it was probably never completed, but a statuette of Sargent was delivered by Rodin to Sargent instead), Sargent finished this powerful portrait of Rodin and delivered it to him. Sargent's portrait of Rodin ensures the viewer’s focus is on Rodin's head and gaze. Rodin's bust and the background are painted in dark tones, so that we are not distracted from Rodin's piercing gaze and long, ginger beard. With this portrait, Sargent manages to convey both Rodin’s physical appearance and his strong personality. Years later, in a newspaper interview Rodin declared that Sargent was "le Van Dyck de l'époque" ("the Van Dyck of our times").

**The Big Bayberry Bush (The Bayberry Bush) - 1895**

William Merritt Chase was born on November 1st, 1849 in Nineveh, Indiana. Throughout his lifetime, he expanded his oeuvre to include portraiture, landscapes, and still life, eventually coming to be regarded as one of American Impressionism’s most prominent painters and teachers.

The loose, organic brushwork that initially garnered him the attention of his instructors came fully into form in his later landscape paintings. In 1891, Chase (reluctantly) accepted a position teaching at the Shinnecock School in Southampton, Long Island. For the next two decades he was a well-loved and respected teacher in the school’s Art Village, the first to teach painting en plein air. “The Bayberry Bush,” painted in 1895, displays the carefree brushwork Chase used to such success. It features three young women walking amongst the scrub in the foreground of a rural, gambrel-roofed house. Known for prominently presenting figures in his landscapes, Chase made them the only sources of pure white in the image besides the clouds, going so far as to garnish the outfit of the subject on the far right with a red bow.

The earth tones that comprise the low vegetation are reflected in the grey shingles and red brick of the house in the background, blurring the lines between landscape and residence. In the distance the earth slopes gradually, meeting a faintly clouded horizon that lightens as it disappears. Chase creates a gentle whimsy in a landscape that had been considered barren and even depressing by some of his contemporaries. As a result, American Impressionist landscape painting spread to such locations as Cape Cod, Massachusetts and Mendota, Minnesota, as well as Carmel, California.- Anthony deFeo
